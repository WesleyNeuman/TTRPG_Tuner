# Project Goal
To create an app that allows a user to test combat encounters for tabletop RPG games

This will be accomplished by allowing users to:
- Create functional approximations of characters and enemies
- Define categorical qualities of these entities that determine their simulation AI
- Perform monte-carlo simulations of designed encounters
